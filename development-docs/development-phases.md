# Knowledge Management System - Development Phases

Development plan for transforming the knowledge management system with Strapi CMS integration.

## Phase 0: Package Updates & Dependencies ✅
**Goal**: Update all packages to latest versions and ensure security

### Tasks:
1. Update Next.js, React, TypeScript to latest stable versions
2. Update ESLint, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and all dev dependencies  
3. Run `npm audit` and fix all security vulnerabilities
4. Remove unused dependencies and consolidate similar packages

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ All packages updated, zero vulnerabilities, clean dependency tree

---

## Phase 1: Code Organization & Type Safety
**Goal**: Establish clean code structure and improve type safety

### Tasks:
1. Enable TypeScript strict mode and add stricter linting rules
2. Create proper type definitions in `src/types/` with Zod validation
3. Reorganize project structure (components/ui/, services/, hooks/, etc.)
4. Fix layout issues and move client-side logic to proper components

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors, clean project structure, all components typed

---

## Phase 2: Component Refactoring & UI Improvements
**Goal**: Consolidate similar components and improve reusability

### Tasks:
1. Replace multiple `book-card-section-content-*.tsx` files with single configurable component
2. Extract reusable UI components and create proper composition patterns
3. Consolidate CSS files and improve Tailwind configuration
4. Add error boundaries, loading skeletons, and proper error handling

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Reduced component duplication, consistent UI patterns, proper error handling

---

## Phase 3: Strapi CMS Integration & Content Migration
**Goal**: Set up Strapi CMS and migrate existing content from filesystem

### Tasks:
1. Install Strapi, design content types (Papers, Books, Sections), configure roles and database
2. Create migration scripts for papers (JSON) and books (markdown) to Strapi
3. Import all media assets to Strapi media library with preserved relationships
4. Create `src/services/strapi.ts` with caching, error handling, and TypeScript types

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Strapi configured, all content migrated, API integration working with caching

---

## Phase 4: Next.js + Strapi SSG Integration
**Goal**: Implement static generation with Strapi as data source

### Tasks:
1. Implement `generateStaticParams` using Strapi API for all pages
2. Remove all `fs.readdirSync` calls and replace with Strapi API calls
3. Create build-time content pipeline fetching from Strapi
4. Set up Strapi webhooks for incremental rebuilds and content preview

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ All pages statically generated from Strapi, sub-second load times, webhook ISR working

---

## Phase 5: Search Integration
**Goal**: Implement fast, intelligent search capabilities

### Tasks:
1. Choose search service (MeiliSearch vs Algolia) and configure indices
2. Create content indexing scripts using Strapi API and search endpoints
3. Build search UI with instant search, debouncing, filters, and highlighting
4. Add semantic search, typo tolerance, and autocomplete features

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Sub-100ms search responses, typo-tolerant search, rich filtering

---

## Phase 6: AI Chatbot Integration
**Goal**: Add AI chatbot with document reading and Q&A capabilities

### Tasks:
1. Choose AI service (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or local LLM) and set up API integration
2. Create document indexing system to feed content from Strapi to AI chatbot
3. Build chatbot UI component with conversation history and document context awareness
4. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to reference specific papers/books in responses

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ AI chatbot can answer questions about your papers and books with citations
