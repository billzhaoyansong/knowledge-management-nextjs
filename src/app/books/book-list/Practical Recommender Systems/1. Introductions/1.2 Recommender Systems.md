# Recommender Systems

- A recommender system calculates and provides relevant content to the user based on knowledge of the user, content, and interactions between the user and the item.

## Taxonomy of Recommender Systems

1. **Domain**
   - The **type of content or items** being recommended.
     - E.g. Movies, music, books, cars, jobs, even people for dating.
   - Significance: Determines not only what is being recommended but also how critical it is to get the recommendation right
     - for instance, recommending foster parents has much higher stakes than suggesting a movie.
2. **Purpose**
   - The **goal or objective** behind the recommendations, for both the end user and the provider.
     - For end users, the purpose is to find relevant content that they want at that specific time.
     - The purpose for the provider is ultimately to make customers pay for the product/service by providing content they want
       - Measuring something else instead of your direct goal is called using a **proxy goal**, e.g. the amount of content viewed
3. **Context**
   - The **environment or situational factors** in which the recommendation is received.
     - E.g. device type (TV, phone, tablet), user location, time of day, even the user’s mood or current activity
4. **Personalization Level**
   - Spectrum: Non-Personalized, Semi/Segment-Personalized, Fully Personalized
5. **Whose Opinions**
   - The **source** behind the recommendation.
     - Expert Recommendations: Curated by specialists (e.g., sommeliers suggesting wines).
     - Crowdsourced Opinions: Derived from aggregated user data, ratings, and behavior.
6. **Privacy and Trustworthiness**
   - How the system handles and protects user data and personal preferences
7. **Interfaces**
   - Interfaces are the front-end where the user interacts with the recommender system. They are designed not only to display the recommended items but also to communicate why those items are being surfaced and how the user can engage with them.

8. **Algorithms**
   - Algorithms transform data—such as user behavior, context, and item metadata—into a ranked list of recommendations tailored to the user.
   - **collaborative filtering**: relies on the idea that users with similar behaviors or tastes in the past will also have similar preferences in the future
     - The recommender then identifies similar users (user-based filtering) or similar items (item-based filtering) to infer what new items might interest a target user
   - **content-based filtering**: creates a profile of each user based on the explicit features of the items the user has previously interacted with.
   - The system analyzes the characteristics of these items — such as keywords, genres, textual descriptions, or even visual attributes for images — and then recommends new items that share similar attributes.
   - **hybrid recommenders**: A mix of the two types
     - Mitigate the cold start problem (using content-based methods) while also capturing trend and group behavior (with collaborative filtering).
     - Balance personalized recommendations with serendipity, offering both items similar to past interests and surprising options that others with similar tastes have enjoyed.
