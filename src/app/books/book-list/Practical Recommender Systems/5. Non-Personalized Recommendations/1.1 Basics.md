# Non-Personalized Recommendations

## Motivation & Definition

- **Non-Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Broad suggestions applicable to **all users**, such as "Most Popular" or "Top 10" lists.
  - Ideal for **cold-start scenarios** (no user data) or platforms with limited interaction history.

- **Implementation Strategies**
  - **Top-N Lists**: Simple rankings based on global metrics like sales, views, or average ratings (e.g., "Top 10 Movies This Week").
  - **Seeded Recommendations**: Uses a specific item (seed) to find related items (e.g., "Frequently Bought Together" via association rules).
    - **Association Rules**: Identifies item relationships using:
      - **Confidence**: $c(X \to Y) = \frac{T(\text{X AND Y})}{T(X)}$
        - $T(X)$: set of transactions that contain $X$
        - e.g. $c(\text{bread} \to \text{milk})=\frac{T(\text{bread AND milk})}{T(bread)}$
      - **Support**: $S(X \to Y) = \frac{T(\text{X AND Y})}{T()}$
        - $T()$: all transactions

- **Practical Applications**:
  - **Charts and Trends**: Displaying popular content (e.g., "Trending Now").
  - **Rule-Based Systems**: Precomputing associations for quick recommendations.

- **Pros and Cons**:
  - Advantages: Low computational cost, easy to implement, effective for new users.
  - Limitations: Lack personalization, may overlook niche preferences.
