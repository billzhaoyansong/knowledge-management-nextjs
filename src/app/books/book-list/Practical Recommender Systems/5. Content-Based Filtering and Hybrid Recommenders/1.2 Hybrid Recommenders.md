# Hybrid Recommenders

- The Confused World of Hybrids
  - **Hybrid systems** blend collaborative filtering (CF), content-based filtering (CBF), and other methods.
  - Challenges include **complexity**, **computational cost**, and maintaining **interpretability**.

---

- The Monolithic Hybrid
  - Integrates multiple data sources into a single model (e.g., combining user-item interactions and content features).
  - **Example**: Extend matrix factorization to include item metadata:  
    $$
    \hat{r}_{ui} = \mathbf{u}_u \cdot \mathbf{v}_i^T + \mathbf{c}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_u^T
    $$
    - $\mathbf{c}_i$: Content features of item $i$.  
    - $\mathbf{w}_u$: User weights for content features.

---

- Mixed Hybrid Recommender
  - Presents recommendations from different algorithms **side-by-side**.
  - **Example**: Display "Top Rated" (non-personalized) and "Similar to Your Favorites" (CBF) in separate UI sections.

---

- The Ensemble
  - Combines predictions from multiple models:
    - **Switched**: Use algorithm $A$ or $B$ based on context (e.g., $A$ for new users, $B$ for power users).
    - **Weighted**: Average predictions:  
      $$ 
      \hat{r}_{ui} = \alpha \cdot \hat{r}_{ui}^{(CF)} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \hat{r}_{ui}^{(CBF)} 
      $$
    - **Stacked**: Use predictions as features for a meta-model (e.g., linear regression).

---

- Feature-Weighted Linear Stacking (FWLS)
  - Advanced ensemble where weights depend on item/user features:  
    $$ 
    \hat{r}_{ui} = \sum_{m=1}^M w_m(f) \cdot \hat{r}_{ui}^{(m)} 
    $$
    - $w_m(f)$: Weight for model $m$, determined by feature $f$ (e.g., user activity level).
    - **Meta-features**: Domain-specific heuristics (e.g., item popularity, user cold-start status).
