# Cold Start

- Definition:
  - Challenges in generating recommendations for **new users** (cold users) or **new items** (cold items) with insufficient interaction data.
    - **Cold Users**: Users with no historical behavior (e.g., new sign-ups).
    - **Cold Items**: Items with no user interactions (e.g., newly added products).
    - **Gray Sheep**: Users with unique preferences that donâ€™t align with any user segment.

- Addressing Cold Start
  - **Cold User**
    - **Demographic/Contextual Filtering**:  
      - Leverage user metadata (age, location) or item metadata (genre, category) for recommendations.  
      - Example: Recommend action movies to users in the "18-25 male" segment.
    - **Association Rules**:  
      1. **Top-N Lists**: Simple rankings based on global metrics like sales, views, or average ratings (e.g., "Top 10 Movies This Week").
      2. **Seeded Recommendations**: Uses a specific item (seed) to find related items (e.g., "Frequently Bought Together" via association rules).
         - **Association Rules**: Identifies item relationships using:
           - **Confidence**: $c(X \to Y) = \frac{T(\text{X AND Y})}{T(X)}$
             - $T(X)$: set of transactions that contain $X$
             - e.g. $c(\text{bread} \to \text{milk})=\frac{T(\text{bread AND milk})}{T(bread)}$
           - **Support**: $S(X \to Y) = \frac{T(\text{X AND Y})}{T()}$
             - $T()$: all transactions
  - **Cold Item**
    - **Content-Based Filtering**:  
      - Use item features (e.g., movie genre, director) to find similarities.
      - Similarity Metric (e.g., TF-IDF or cosine similarity):
