# Neighboorhood Methods

- Key Similarity Metrics

  - User-User Similarity: Find users with overlapping preferences.
  - Item-Item Similarity: Find items frequently consumed together.

  | Similarity Metric     | Description | Formula |
  |----------------------|-------------|---------|
  | **Jaccard Similarity**  | Measures overlap between sets (e.g., items viewed by two users). | $$\text{Jaccard}(A, B) = \frac{\vert A \cap B\vert}{\|A \cup B\|}$$, where $A, B$: Sets of items/users |
  | **Cosine Similarity**   | Measures angle between vectors (e.g., user rating vectors), and values range from $[-1, 1]$ (1 = identical, -1 = opposites) | $$\text{Cosine}(A, B) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\vert\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\vert}$$ |
  | **Pearson Correlation** | Measures linear correlation between ratings (adjusts for rating bias). | $$r_{AB} = \frac{\sum (A_i - \bar{A})(B_i - \bar{B})}{\sqrt{\sum (A_i - \bar{A})^2} \sqrt{\sum (B_i - \bar{B})^2}}$$, where $\bar{A}, \bar{B}$: Mean ratings of users $A$ and $B$ |
  | **Euclidean Distance**  | Measures straight-line distance in vector space. | $$d(A, B) = \sqrt{\sum (A_i - B_i)^2}$$ |

- Neighborhood Methods
  - **Goal**: Predict user preferences by leveraging behavior patterns of **similar users/items**.
  - **Types**:
    - **User-User CF**: "Users like you also liked..."  
    - **Item-Item CF**: "People who viewed this also viewed..."  
  - **Key Algorithms**
    - **User-User Prediction Formula**:  
      - Weighted average of ratings from similar users:  
        $$
        \hat{r}_{ui} = \bar{r}_u + \frac{\sum_{v \in N} sim(u, v) \cdot (r_{vi} - \bar{r}_v)}{\sum_{v \in N} |sim(u, v)|}
        $$  
        - $ \hat{r}_{ui} $: Predicted rating for user $u$ and item $i$.  
        - $ sim(u, v) $: Similarity between users $u$ and $v$ (e.g., cosine or Pearson).  
    - **Item-Item Prediction Formula**:  
      - Weighted average of ratings for similar items:  
        $$
        \hat{r}_{ui} = \frac{\sum_{j \in N} sim(i, j) \cdot r_{uj}}{\sum_{j \in N} |sim(i, j)|} 
        $$  
        - $ sim(i, j) $: Similarity between items $i$ and $j$.  
    - **Amazonâ€™s Item-to-Item Algorithm**:  
      - Uses **co-occurrence** in user baskets:  
        $$
        \text{Score}(i, j) = \frac{\text{Count}(i \cap j)}{\text{Count}(i)} 
        $$

- Implementation Steps
  1. **Clustering with k-Means**
     1. Initialize $k$ centroids randomly.
     2. Assign points to nearest centroid.
     3. Recalculate centroids as cluster means.
     4. Repeat until convergence.
  2. **Calculate Similarities**:
     - Use metrics like cosine, Pearson, or Jaccard.  
  3. **Aggregate Ratings**:
     - Compute weighted averages for predictions.
