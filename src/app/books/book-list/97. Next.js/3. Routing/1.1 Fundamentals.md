- Tree: A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure.
- Subtree: Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).
- Root: The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.
- Leaf: Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.

## Roles of Folders and Files

- **Folders** are used to define routes.
  - A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.js file.
  - To create a **nested route**, you can nest folders inside each other.
- inside each folder, **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment.
  - files and their rendering hierarchy:
    1. `layout.js`: Shared UI for a segment and its children
    2. `template.js`: Specialized re-rendered Layout UI
    3. `error.js` (React error boundary): Error UI for a segment and its children
    4. `loading.js` (React suspense boundary): Loading UI for a segment and its children
    5. `not-found.js` (React error boundary): Not found UI for a segment and its children
    6. `page.js` or nested layout.js: Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible

## Colocation

- you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the app directory with special files named before, without worrying your own files being routable

## Advanced Routing Patterns

- **Parallel Routes**: Allow you to simultaneously show two or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. You can use them for split views that have their own sub-navigation. E.g. Dashboards.
- **Intercepting Routes**: Allow you to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route. You can use these when keeping the context for the current page is important. E.g. Seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed.
