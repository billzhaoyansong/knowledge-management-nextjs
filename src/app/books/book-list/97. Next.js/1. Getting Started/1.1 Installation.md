```cmd
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes

## Run

`npm run dev` then visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Set up

1. TypeScript
   - Next.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker
   - You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:
     1. Opening the command palette (`Ctrl/âŒ˜` + `Shift` + `P`)
     2. Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
     3. Selecting "Use Workspace Version"
2. ESLint
   - Next.js comes with built-in ESLint when you create a new project with `create-next-app`.
   - To add ESLint to an **existing** project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "lint": "next lint"
    }
  }
  ```
  
3. Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases

e.g., in `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`, you can configure `baseUrl` and `paths` by:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/",
    "paths": {
      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

then in `tsx` files, you can import styles and components like:

```tsx
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'
 
// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'

import '@/styles/styles.css'
 
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  )
}
```
