# Binary Tree - Augmentation and Applications

## Augmentations

1. **Pre Order Traverse a Binary Tree with Loop**
   - a. push root into stack
   - b. pop stack 
   - c. push right then left into stack 
   - d. go back to step 'b' 
2. **In Order Traverse a Binary Tree with Loop**
   - a. push from root to most left of tree node into stack
   - b. pop and push from popped_node.right to left most node of popped_node.right 
3. **Post Order Traverse a Binary Tree with Loop**
   - a. push root into stack 1 
   - b. pop root into stack 2 and push left and right child into stack 1 
   - c. pop stack 1 into stack 2 and push left and right child of popped node into stack 1 
   - d. after stack 1 is empty, recursively pop stack 2 
4. **Level by Level Printing Binary Tree**
   - use 2 queues 
   - push root into queue 1, pop queue 1, push left and right child into queue 2 
   - pop queue 2, push left and right child of popped node into queue 1 
   - then pop queue 1 and queue 2 alternatively 
5. **Level by Level Printing Binary Tree in a zigzag style**
   - Use 2 stacks 
6. **Morris Inorder Traversal**

    ```python
    if c_node has left:
        find predecessor 
        if predecessor.right is null:
            predecessor.right = c_node 
            c_node = c_node.left
        else:
            predecessor.right = null 
            visit(c_node) 
            c_node = c_node.right 
    else:
        visit(c_node) 
        c_node = c_node.right 

    visit mid and right child 
    ```

7. **Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree**
   - depth-first search 
   - once find one of the searching node, return the node to its parent

8. **Check Whether Tree 2 is in Tree 1 ($O(m\times n)$)**
   - check current node subtree and propagate to left and right child
9. **Check Whether Tree 1 has a subtree of same topology structure as Tree 2($O(m+n)$)**
   - preorder serialization of tree
10. **Check Whether a Binary Tree is Complete**
    - level by level traversal 
    - if a node has right child but no left child, return false 
    - if a node has neither of the children or has only left children, the following nodes should also has no children 
11. **Compute the # Nodes in Complete Binary Tree**
    - use  binary search - like algorithm 
12. **Check Whether a Binary tree is Binary Search Tree**
    - Use in order traversal and check if the result array is in ascending order 
13. **Largest Binary Search Tree in Binary Tree**
    - use post order from bottom up 
    - Largest BST in Binary Tree 
14. **Check Whether a Binary Tree is Balanced**
    - $|height(node.left)âˆ’height(node.right)|\leq1|$ for every node 
    - post order traversal 
15. **Longest Distance Between nodes of a Binary Tree**
    - `longest distance = max {L_D in left subtree, L_D in right subtree, L_D between left and right subtree}`
    - post order traversal
