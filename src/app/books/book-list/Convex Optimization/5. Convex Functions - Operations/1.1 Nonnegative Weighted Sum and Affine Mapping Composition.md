### Nonnegative Weighted Sums and Composition with Affine Mapping

#### Nonnegative Weighted Sums
* if $f_1,...,f_m$ are convex functions and $w_i\geq0$, then $f=w_1f_1+\cdots w_mf_m$ is also a convex function
* nonnegative weighted sum of concave functions is concave

#### Composition with an Affine Mapping
Suppose $f:R^n\to R, A\in R^{n\times m}$, and $b\in R^n$. Define $g:R^m\to R$ by

$$
g(x)=f(Ax+b),
$$

with $\text{dom}g=\{x|Ax+b\in\text{dom}f\}$. Then 
* if $f$ is convex, so is $g$
* if $f$ is concave, so is $g$
