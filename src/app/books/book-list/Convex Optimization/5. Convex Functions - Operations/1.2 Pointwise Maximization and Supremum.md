### Pointwise Maximum and Supremum

Pointwise Maximum
* If $f_1,...,f_m$ are convex, then their pointwise maximum $f(x)=\max\{f_1(x),...,f_m(x)\}$ is convex

Pointwise Supremum
* If for each $y\in\mathcal{A}, f(x,y)$ is convex in $x$, then the function $g(x)=\sup_{y\in\mathcal{A}}f(x,y)$ is convex in $x$

notes:  
* the maximum is the largest member of the set, while the supremum is the smallest upper bound of the set. ([stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/160451/difference-between-supremum-and-maximum))
* In terms of epigraphs, the pointwise supremum of functions corresponds to the intersection of epigraphs $\text{epi}g=\bigcap_{y\in\mathcal{A}}f(\cdot,y)$
