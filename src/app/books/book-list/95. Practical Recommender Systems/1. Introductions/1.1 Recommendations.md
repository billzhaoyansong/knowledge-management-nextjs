# Real-life Recommendations

## Commercials vs Recommendations

- **Advertisements/Commercials**
  - These are paid-for messages pushed by sellers **to promote a product or service for the benefit of the sender**
  - E.g. supermarket flyers in your mailbox or TV commercials at the airport are designed principally for the benefit of the sender
  - They can be categorized into _targeted commercials_ (commercial in right television content) or _highly targeted commercials_ (based on viewer's estimated age and gender to present contents)
- **Recommendations**
  - Recommendations are calculated by a system using information about your personal preferences and behavior **to help you discover items that align closely with your interests to serve the user**

## Recommendations

- **From the perspective of user**
  - **Non-Personalized Recommendation**
    - These are suggestions made based on **general data** — like aggregated popularity or trends — without tailoring them to individual preferences.
      - For example, a weekly top-10 movies list in a newspaper helps users discover what’s popular.
    - Its aim is to guide users in their decision-making based on collective behavior rather than personal taste.
  - **Semi/Segment-Personalized Recommendations**
    - These recommendations cater to **groups (or segments) with shared characteristics.**
      - For instance, a streaming service might show recommendations based on regional tastes or age groups.
  - **Fully Personalized Recommendations**
    - These are tailored to each **user’s long-term unique behavior, preferences, and history**
    - The idea of the personalized recommendation is that people are  interested in both the popular item and items that are in the _long tail_
- **From the perspective of the expert**
  - **Expert Recommendations**
    - In some domains, **recommendations originate from trusted expert opinions** rather than purely algorithmic calculations.
      - E.g. a wine website where sommeliers curate and recommend bottles, or a book club where literary critics suggest must-read titles.
- **From the perspective of products**
  - **Seeded Recommendations**
    - These are **recommendations based on a seed**, which could be the current item that a user is viewing, such as a movie, song, or product
    - They suggest similar ones based on shared features or user behavior.
      - E.g. _Customers Who Bought This Also Bought…_ feature on e-commerce sites or _Because You Watched…_ lists on streaming platforms
- **From the perspetive of context**
  - **Context-Aware or Time-Based Recommendations**
    - This type adapts suggestions **depending on the user’s current situation** — whether it’s the time of day, the device in use, or even the user’s location or mood.
      - E.g., a café app might suggest the nearest places to grab a coffee when you’re on the move, or a streaming service might favor light content during daytime hours and more immersive dramas in the evening.
