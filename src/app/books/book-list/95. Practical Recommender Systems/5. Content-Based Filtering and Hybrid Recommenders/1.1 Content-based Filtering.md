# Content-based Filtering

- Goal: Recommend items similar to those a user has liked, based on **item features** (e.g., genre, director, keywords).
- Key Algorithms
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Identifies important words in item descriptions.  
    - **TF**: Term frequency in a document:  
      - $ \text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{\text{Count of } t \text{ in } d}{\text{Total terms in } d} $  
    - **IDF**: Inverse document frequency:  
      - $ \text{IDF}(t) = \log \frac{\text{Total documents}}{\text{Documents containing } t} $  
    - **TF-IDF Score**:  
      - $ \text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t) $  
  - **Cosine Similarity**:  
    - Compares item/user profiles:  
      - $ \text{Similarity}(A, B) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|} $  
  - **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**:  
    - Topic modeling to uncover hidden themes in item descriptions.  
      - Assigns items to **latent topics** (e.g., "Sci-Fi," "Romance").

- User Profile Creation
  - **Aggregate Item Features**: Average TF-IDF vectors of items the user liked:  
    - $\text{User Profile} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \text{TF-IDF}(i)$

- Implementation Steps
  1. **Feature Extraction**: Convert movie descriptions to TF-IDF vectors.  
  2. **User Profile**: Average TF-IDF vectors of movies the user rated highly.  
  3. **Recommendations**: Find movies with TF-IDF vectors similar to the user profile.

- Pros and Cons
  - **Pros**:  
    - Works with **no user interaction data**.  
    - Transparent (explainable via features).  
  - **Cons**:  
    - Limited to item metadata quality.  
    - Can create **filter bubbles** (lack of diversity).
