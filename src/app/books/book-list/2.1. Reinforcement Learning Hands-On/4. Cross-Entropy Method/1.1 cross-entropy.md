# Cross-Entropy Method

## High-Level Idea

- model-free, policy-based, on-policy
- Philosophy
  - draws an **analogy** between _**(1) selecting actions in RL**_ and _**(2) predicting classes in supervised classification**_
    - the number of classes = the number of actions
- How to implement
  - After the agent plays several episodes — where randomness in the environment and action selection leads to varying performance — the Cross-Entropy Method discards poor episodes and retrains on the better ones.
- Steps
  1. Play $N$ episodes using our current model and environment.
  2. Calculate the total reward for every episode and decide on a reward boundary. Usually, we use a percentile of all rewards, such as the $50$th or $70$th.
  3. Throw away all episodes with a reward below the boundary.
  4. Train on the remaining ”elite” episodes (with rewards higher than the boundary) using observations as the input and issued actions as the desired output.
  5. Repeat from step 1 until we become satisfied with the result.

## Cartpole

- Observation Space
  - `Box(4,)`
    - `[-4.8 -inf -0.41887903 -inf], [4.8 inf 0.41887903 inf]`
      - Cart position: Value in $[−4.8, 4.8]$ range
      - Cart velocity: Value in $(-\infty, \infty)$ range
      - Pole angle: Value in radians in $[−0.418, 0.418]$ range
      - Pole angular velocity: Value in $(-\infty, \infty)$ range
- Action Space
  - `Discrete(2,)`
    - `0`: push to left
    - `1`: push to right
