# 6.4 Model Launch

- to save the model

```python
import joblib

joblib.dump(final_model, "my_california_housing_model.pkl")
```

- to load the model

```python
import joblib
[...]  # import KMeans, BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, rbf_kernel, etc.

def column_ratio(X): [...]
def ratio_name(function_transformer, feature_names_in): [...]
class ClusterSimilarity(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin): [...]

final_model_reloaded = joblib.load("my_california_housing_model.pkl")

new_data = [...]  # some new districts to make predictions for
predictions = final_model_reloaded.predict(new_data)
```

- after deployment, the ML performance needs to be monitered
  - It may drop very quickly, for example if a component breaks in your infrastructure
  - it could also decay very slowly because of model rot
    - e.g. if the model was trained with last year’s data, it may not be adapted to today’s data
- evaluation of the model’s input data quality is also required
  - e.g. you could trigger an alert if more and more inputs are missing a feature, or 
  - the mean or standard deviation drifts too far from the training set, or 
  - a categorical feature starts containing new categories
