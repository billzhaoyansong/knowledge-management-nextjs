# 13.5 Early Stopping

- As the epochs go by, the algorithm learns, and its prediction error (RMSE) on the training set goes down, along with its prediction error on the validation set.
- After a while, though, the validation error stops decreasing and starts to go back up. This indicates that the model has started to overfit the training data.
