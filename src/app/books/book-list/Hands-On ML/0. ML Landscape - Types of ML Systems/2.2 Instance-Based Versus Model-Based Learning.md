# 1.3 Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning

## Instance-based learning

- In instance-based learning, new instances are compared with stored instances to determine the output.
  - e.g. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Model-based learning

- In model-based learning, a model of these stored instances are built and the model is used to make predictions.
