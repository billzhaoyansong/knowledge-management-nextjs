# 1.1 Training Supervisions

## Supervised learning

- In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the __desired solutions__
  - in a _classification_ task, __labels__ are fed into the system
    - e.g. spam email filter
  - in a _regression_ task, __targets__ are fed into the system
    - e.g. car price predictor
  - some regression models can be used for classification as well, and vice versa
    - e.g. logistic regression is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class
- __features__ are sometimes called _predictors_ or _attributes_

## Unsupervised learning

- In unsupervised learning, the training data is __unlabeled__
  - e.g.
    - _clustering_ algorithm to cluster the visitors of a website
    - _visualization_ algorithms to provide 2D or 3D representation of your data
    - _dimensionality reduction_ to simplify the data without losing too much information
    - _anomaly detection_ and _novelty detection_
    - _association rule learning_ to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes

## Semi-supervised learning

- in semi-supervised learning, plenty of instances are __unlabeled__, and few instances are  __labeled__
  - e.g. in photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7.
- Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms
  - e.g. a clustering algorithm may be used to group similar instances together, and then every unlabeled instance can be labeled with the most common label in its cluster. Once the whole dataset is labeled, it is possible to use any supervised learning algorithm.

## Self-supervised learning

- in self-supervised learning, a fully __labeled__ dataset is generated __from__ a fully __unlabeled__ one

## Reinforcement learning

- in reinforcement learning, the learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the __environment__, select and perform __actions__, and get __rewards__ in return.
- the __policy__ is learnt by the agent to get the most reward over time
