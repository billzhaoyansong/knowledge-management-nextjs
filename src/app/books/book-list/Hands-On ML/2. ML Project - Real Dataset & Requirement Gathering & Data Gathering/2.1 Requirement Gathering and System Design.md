# 3.2 Requirement Gathering and System Design

- Things to do before you start to develop a ML system

## (1) Knowing the Objective

- it will determine how you frame the problem, which algorithms you will select, which performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you will spend tweaking it

## (2) Design your system

- determine what kind of training supervision the model will need: is it a supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning task?
- is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else?
- should you use batch learning or online learning techniques?

## (3) Select a performance measure

- A typical performance measure for regression problems is the __root mean square error (RMSE)__, also called _Euclidean Norm_ or $l_2$ norm ($\Vert\cdot\Vert_2$ or simply $\Vert\cdot\Vert$)
  - $\text{RMSE}(\textbf{X},h)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\left(h\left(\textbf{x}^{(i)}\right)-y^{(i)}\right)^2}$
    - $m$: number of instances in dataset
    - $\textbf{x}^{(i)}$: a vector of all the feature values (excluding the label) of the $i$th instance in the dataset, $y^{(i)}$: its label (the desired output value for that instance)
      - e.g. $\mathbf{x}^{(1)}=\begin{pmatrix} -118.29 \\ 33.91 \\1,416 \\ 38,372 \end{pmatrix}$, $y^{(1)}=156,400$
    - $\textbf{X}$: a matrix containing all feature values of all instances
      - e.g. $\textbf{X}=\begin{pmatrix}(\mathbf{x}^{(1)})^T \\ (\mathbf{x}^{(2)})^T \\ \vdots \\ (\mathbf{x}^{(2000)})^T \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}-118.29 & 33.91 & 1,416 & 38,372 \\ \vdots & \vdots &\vdots &\vdots\end{pmatrix}$
    - $h$: prediction function, it outputs a _predicted value_ $\hat{y}^{(i)}=h(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$
- if there are _many outlier districts_, you may consider using the __mean absolute error (MAE)__, also called the _average absolute deviation_, _Manhattan Norm_ or $l_1$ norm ($\Vert\cdot\Vert_1$)
  - $\text{MAE}(\textbf{X},h)=\frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\left\vert\left(h\left(\textbf{x}^{(i)}\right)-y^{(i)}\right)\right\vert$
- generally
  - the $l_k$ norm of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ containing $n$ elements is defined as $\left\Vert\mathbf{v}\right\Vert_k=(|v_1|^k+\cdots+|v_n|^k)^{1/k}$
  - $l_0$ gives the number of nonzero elements in the vector
  - $l_\infty$ gives the maximum absolute value in the vector
  - The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones
    - This is why the RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE
    - the RMSE performs very well when outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell-shaped curve)

## (4) Check the assumptions

- to list and verify the assumptions that have been made so far (by you or others) to help you catch serious issues early on
