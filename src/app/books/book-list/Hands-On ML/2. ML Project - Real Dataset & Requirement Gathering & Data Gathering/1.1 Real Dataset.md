- The `sklearn.datasets` package contains mostly three types of functions:
  - `fetch_*` functions such as `fetch_openml()` to download real-life datasets

    ```python
    # other fetch_*: fetch_kddcup99, fetch_california_housing, etc
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

    # the MNIST dataset contains images, and DataFrames aren’t ideal for that, 
    # so it’s preferable to set as_frame=False to get the data as NumPy arrays instead
    mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', as_frame=False)
    ```

  - `load_*` functions to load small toy datasets bundled with Scikit-Learn (so they don’t need to be downloaded over the internet), and
  - `make_*` functions to generate fake datasets, useful for tests.
