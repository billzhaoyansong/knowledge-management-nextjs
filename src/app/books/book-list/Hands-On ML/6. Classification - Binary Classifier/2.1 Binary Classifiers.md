# 7.2 Binary classifier

- the "$5$-detector"
  - benefits of the SGD classifier
    - capable of handling very large datasets efficiently
    - SGD deals with training instances independently, one at a time
    - SGD well suited for online learning

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

y_train_5 = (y_train == '5')  # True for all 5s, False for all other digits
y_test_5 = (y_test == '5')

sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(random_state=42)
sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5)

forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
```
