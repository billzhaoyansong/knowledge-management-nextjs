# 1.2 Batch Training vs Online Training

## Batch learning

- in batch learning, the system must be trained using all the available data
- the performance of a batch learning system cannot fit a rapidly changing scenario (e.g. predict stock price)
- the batch learning system need to train a new version from scratch on the full dataset (both new and old)

## Online learning

- In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called mini-batches.
- online learning algorithms can be used to train models on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory (this is called out-of-core learning)
- One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the _learning rate_. If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data
- A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system’s performance will decline, possibly quickly
