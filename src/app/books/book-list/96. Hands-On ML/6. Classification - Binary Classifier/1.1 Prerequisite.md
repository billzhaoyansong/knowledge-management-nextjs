```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

# DataFrames aren’t ideal for that, so it’s preferable to set as_frame=False to use Numpy
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', as_frame=False)

# the MNIST dataset has split the training set (the first 60,000 images) and test set (the last 10,000 images)
X, y = mnist.data, mnist.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[:60000], X[60000:], y[:60000], y[60000:]
```
