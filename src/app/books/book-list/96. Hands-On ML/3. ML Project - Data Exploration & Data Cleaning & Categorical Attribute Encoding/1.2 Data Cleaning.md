# 4.2 Data Cleaning

- prerequisite
  - make a copy of the training set and _seperate the predictors and the labels_

    ```python
    # drop() creates a copy of the data and does not affect strat_train_set
    housing = strat_train_set.drop("median_house_value", axis=1)
    housing_labels = strat_train_set["median_house_value"].copy()
    ```

- for missing values, you have 3 options:
  - get rid of samples with missing value: `housing.dropna(subset=["total_bedrooms"], inplace=True)`
  - get rid of the whole attribute: `housing.drop("total_bedrooms", axis=1)`
  - __imputation__: set the missing values to some value (zero, the mean, the median, etc.), this is the _least destructive option_
    - imputation implemented by ourselves

        ```python
        median = housing["total_bedrooms"].median()
        housing["total_bedrooms"].fillna(median, inplace=True)
        ```

    - imputation implemented with scikit-learn

        ```python
        # other imputers (numerical attributes only)
        #   KNNImputer replaces each missing value with the mean of the k-nearest neighbors’ values for that feature.
        #   IterativeImputer trains a regression model per feature to predict the missing values based on all the other available features.
        from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

        # other options: 
        #   (strategy="median"): numerical
        #   (strategy="most_frequent"): numerical, categorical
        #   (strategy="constant", fill_value=…​): numerical, categorical
        imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="median")

        # create a copy of the data with only the numerical attributes
        housing_num = housing.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

        # fit imputer to the training data
        # to check the result: imputer.statistics_ or housing_num.median().values
        imputer.fit(housing_num)

        # transform the training set by replacing missing values
        # as the output is numpy array, it is better to wrap it in a dataframe
        X = imputer.transform(housing_num)
        housing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns,
                                  index=housing_num.index)
        ```
