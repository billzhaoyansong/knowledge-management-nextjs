# 4.1 Data Exploration

## Prerequisites

- only exploring the training set (put the test set aside)
- if the training set is large, sample an _exploration set_
- make a copy of the original so you can revert
  - `housing = strat_train_set.copy()`

## Visualizing

```python
# s: radius of circle
# c: color
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", grid=True,
             s=housing["population"] / 100, label="population",
             c="median_house_value", cmap="jet", colorbar=True,
             legend=True, sharex=False, figsize=(10, 7))
plt.show()
```

## Commands to peek data

- problems can be watched in histograms
  - attributes have very different scales, __feature scaling__ can be used to solve it
  - many histograms are skewed left/right, __transforming__ these attributes to have more symmetrical and bell-shaped distributions will facilitate ML algorithms to detect patterns

    ```python
    # top five rows of data
    housing.head()
    # a quick description of the data, in particular #rows, each attributeâ€™s type, and #non-null values
    housing.info() 

    # for categorical attributes, how many districts belong to each category 
    housing["ocean_proximity"].value_counts()
    # for numerical attributes, shows a summary including count, mean, std, min, max, etc
    housing.describe()

    # for numerical attributes, draw histograms
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    housing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.show()
    ```

## Look for Correlations

- to compute the __standard correlation coefficient__ (Pearson's r)

    ```python
    corr_matrix = housing.corr()

    # how much each attribute correlates with the median house value
    corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)
    ```

- to use the Pandas `scatter_matrix()` function, which plots every numerical attribute against every other numerical attribute
  - therefore, for 11 numerical attributes, you would get $11^2=121$ plots.
  - this is a good place to detect and __remove data quirks__ to prevent your algorithms to reproduce data quirks

    ```python
    from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix

    # only focus on these attributes
    attributes = ["median_house_value", "median_income", "total_rooms",
                "housing_median_age"]
    scatter_matrix(housing[attributes], figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.show()

    # to take a closer look at the scatter plot between 'median_income' and 'median_house_value'
    housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="median_income", y="median_house_value",
             alpha=0.1, grid=True)
    plt.show()
    ```

  - The main diagonal plots display histograms(or other plots by configuration), instead of straight lines

## Experiment with attribute combinations

- try out various attribute combinations
  - unnecessarily thorough, but a good point to quickly gain insights
  - this can be an iterative process: once you get a prototype up and running, you can analyze its output to gain more insights and come back to this exploration step

    ```python
    housing["rooms_per_house"] = housing["total_rooms"] / housing["households"]
    housing["bedrooms_ratio"] = housing["total_bedrooms"] / housing["total_rooms"]
    housing["people_per_house"] = housing["population"] / housing["households"]

    corr_matrix = housing.corr()
    corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)
    ```
