# Loss Functions - Regression

## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Intro
  - MAE is also known as the $L_1$ loss, is a loss function used for regression tasks.

  - $\text{MAE}(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |\hat{y_i} - y_i|$

- Discussion
  - MAE is _**mostly insensitive to outliers**_ because each absolute error contributes only linearly to the loss. It can be a good choice when we donâ€™t want outliers to disproportionately influence the loss.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Intro
  - MSE is also known as the L2 loss, is a loss function used for regression tasks

  - $\text{MSE}(\hat{y}, y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y_i} - y_i)^2$

- Discussion
  - MSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE because it squares each error term, which _**disproportionately increases the contribution of larger errors**_ to the total loss.

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- Intro
  - RMSE is deduced from the MSE
  - $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}$
  - <img style="width:75%;max-width:150px;" src="/books/Transformers_LLMs/training_RMSE_Loss_Illus.png"/>
- Discussion
  - Compared to MSE, RMSE can be useful because it provides an error metric in the same unit as the target variable, making it easier to interpret the magnitude of prediction errors.
