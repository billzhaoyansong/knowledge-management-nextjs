    "propose __a blockchain network-based mechanism__ including client selection, contribution evaluation, and smart-contract based auction, to achieve [1] higher accuracy in the global model, [2] less number of FL rounds, compared to [1] Random FL selection [2] FL-MAB",
    "in the mechanism, where clients are selected based on [1] compute and network resources, and [2] quality of local data [3] bidding price [4] reputation",
    "contribution evaluated by the Shapley algorithm is used in reward allocation and reputation update",
    "Auction smart contract is deployed in the blockchain network to facilitate the auctioning process"

    "$1$ server $O$, a set $K=\\{1,2,..,n\\}$ of clients possessing local data of size $d=\\{d_1,...,d_n\\}$, $1$ blockchain network",
    "process 1): the server $O$ deploys an FL smart contract and the Auction smart contract in the blockchain network",
    "process 2): the blockchain network announces the scoring rule $S(r_1,\\dots, r_m, p)$ and sends to clients",
    "process 3): clients send their sealed bid $S(r_i,p_i)$ with a deposited amount to the blockchain and wait for the bidding period over [see <u>1. Bidding Contents</u>]",
    "process 4): the Auction smart contract returns the deposited amount and selects $50\\%$ of clients with the highest scores; if this is the first round, only $S(r_i,p_i)$ will be considered, if this is not the first round, both $S(r_i,p_i)$ and reputation $\\theta_i$ will be considered (details on how reputation is employed is not introduced in the article)",
    "process 5): local training for this round",
    "process 6): contribution evaluation based on Shapley algorithm and reward [see <u>2. Rewarding</u>]",
    "process 7): reputations are updated [see <u>3. Reputation Update</u>]",
