  "motivation": [
    "In practical applications, FL clients' local data distributions can be highly heterogeneous due to diverse usage patterns.",
    "This problem is referred to as the non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data challenge, which negatively affects training convergence and the performance of the resulting FL model",
    "Recently, heterogeneous federated learning approaches have been proposed in an attempt to address this challenge. ",
    "These works try to make class distributions of different FL clients similar to improve the performance of the resulting FL model.",
    "To align client data distributions without exposing the FL process to privacy risks, we group together heterogeneous FL clients so that each group can be perceived as a homogeneous “client” to participate in FL."
