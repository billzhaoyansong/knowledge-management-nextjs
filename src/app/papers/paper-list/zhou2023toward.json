  "motivation": [
    "It is noted that while a standard federated learning framework operates under a two-layer architecture, practical IoV systems present a hierarchical structure. ",
    "That is, there are other types of nodes sitting between the cloud server and vehicles.",
    "It is thus necessary and desirable to adapt the standard two-layer federated learning framework to a multi-layer one so as to suit the hierarchical architecture of IoV systems",
    "This can cope with the high latency issue faced by executing two-layer federated learning directly between the vehicles and cloud server which communicate over wide-area networks",
    "However, the intermediate RSUs at the edge may also be compromised and act maliciously.",
    "This poses a need to address the threats from the intermediate RSUs. ",
    "Therefore, with federated learning adapted to such a hierarchical structure for the IoV, how to achieve robustness against poisoning attacks from malicious vehicles and intermediate RSUs remains to be fully explored."
