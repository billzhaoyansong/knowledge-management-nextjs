    "in the FL social network, propose __[1] a clients grouping scheme__ for IoT devices in which devices are clustered via social awareness and trained within the cluster only (no other server) and __[2] a global FL time minimization algorithm__ by optimizing device frequency and resource allocation",
    "propose a global FL time minimization problem by optimizing local device frequency and allocated resources via enabling clustering in a novel social aware FL system model, multiple diagrams showing the learning time against iterations, resource blocks, devices frequencies are also given",
    "1) select clustering head based on social relationships, 2) clustering devices towards clustering heads, 3) optimize local device frequency and resource allocation"
