    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a client selection method to maximize the product of participation state, aggregation weight, and local loss__ for the volatile FL (set volatility (varying clients), statistical volatility (varying dataset), training volatility (failing during training)) to achieve [1] faster convergence speed [2] higher global model accuracy, and [3] reducing energy consumption comparing with [1] random selection, [2] FedCS, and [3] Oort",
    "proved that for non-convex and strongly convex cases, a larger product of participation state, aggregation weight, and local loss leads to a lower error and faster convergence rate",
    "the client selection method aims to maximize the product of participation state, aggregation weight, and local loss",
    "the original client selection problem is transformed into a contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem due to volatile set and unknown model exchange time"
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "However, a challenge is that there have not enough wireless resources for all clients to upload their models due to the limited bandwidth.",
    "To overcome this, client selection, which chooses a part of clients to participate in the FL training, has been considered an effective method for optimizing FL.",
    "Existing works have made some contributions to this problem.",
    "However, the current line of research evades four volatile factors: set volatility, statistical volatility, training volatility, and transmitting volatility.",
    "Regrettably, in existing works, they all assume that the clients contained in the whole training process of FL are a constant set and ignore the problem of new clients joining the training process.",
    "Data collected at different times may exhibit some discrepancies even for the same client.",
    "Local training of some clients is likely to fail due to numerous unexpected reasons (such as unintentional shutdown, low battery, and user abort)",
    "the model may fail to be transmitted during the transmission process due to poor channel conditions and high latency",
    "Although some works have separately considered the training volatility and transmitting volatility, all of their works are based on the assumption that the client set and client dataset are constant."
