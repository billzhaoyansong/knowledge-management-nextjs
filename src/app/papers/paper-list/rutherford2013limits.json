  "motivation": [
    "Despite these numerous successes, we still have limited understanding of the limits of technology-mediated mobilization",
    "If we are to rely on social media to react to time-critical emergencies, it is important to understand the conditions under which they can be successful and the risks of failure associated with them",
    "A particular case, of highly practical importance, is to understand the extent to which we can expect to cover a certain geographical area in a given amount of time",
    "For this, we must understand the complete statistical characterization of the population recruited, geographical area covered, and completion time it takes for social mobilization to succeed in a particular task, as well as to quantify the likelihood of failure.",
    "This lack of understanding is especially prone to selection bias over few successful social mobilization strategies and may lead to inflated expectations of the reliability and efficacy of these techniques (11, 12)",
    "However, it is beyond experimental capabilities to perform randomized experimentation with large crowdsourcing challenges [with notable exceptions emerging recently"
