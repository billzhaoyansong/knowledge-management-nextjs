    "propose __an reverse auction FL framework__ to jointly consider fairness, costs and reputations, achieving [1] higher test accuracy [2] reduced cost [3] improved fairness [4] root mean square error (quantify the difference between real labels and predicted labels, reflecting on well the model performs in regression tasks), compared with [1] random selection [2] greedy selection [3] reputation-based party selection [4] reputation-based party selection with fairness [5] RRAFL [6] FAIR",

    "step 1): the MU broadcasts data quantity requirements for all FL tasks $\\{k_j(t)\\}_{\\tau_j \\in \\mathcal{T}}$",
    "step 2): each DO determines asking profile $A_i(t)=\\{Y_i(t), a_i(t)\\}$, where $Y_i(t)=\\{y_{ij}\\}$ is the amount of contributing data samples and $a_i(t)$ is the price, based on available data and cost $c_i(t)$ and submits to the MU",
    "step 3): the MU selects winners $S(t)$ and determines payment $p_i(t)$ [see <u>1. Client Selection and Incentive Mechanism</u>]",
    "step 4): the MU and selected winners conduct FL",
    "step 5): the MU pays the customized price $p_i(t)$ to each winner in $S(t)$"

  "motivation": [
    "In this work, our central focus is on addressing the model user side problem within the AFL framework",
    "Nevertheless, these approaches often overlook the interests of data owners, such as their opportunities for active participation in the FL process. ",
    "This neglect can lead certain data owners to perceive unfair treatment within the AFL ecosystem.",
    "Failing to ensure fair treatment for FL data owners may result in data owner attrition, a development that can have adverse consequences for the long-term sustainability of AFL systems",
    "Consequently, the challenge of helping the model user recruit data owners in a manner that balances FL model performance and fair treatment within the AFL ecosystem remains an open question"
