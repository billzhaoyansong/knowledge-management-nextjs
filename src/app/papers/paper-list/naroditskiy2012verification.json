  "summaries": [
    "propose __incentive mechanisms__ for referral-based crowdsourcing to minimize the cost of receiving the correct answer",
    "incentive mechanisms include [1] incentivizing the parent node to verify the result of reporting node [2] incentivizing the parent node to participate"
  ],
  "systemModel": [
    "in the referral-based crowdsourcing, a root node is enabled to publish an information gathering task with a certain budget",
    "the referred participant and those who refer the participant will divide the budget based on a split contract [see 1. Split Contract]",
    "Assumptions include [1] any node other than the reporter can verify, [2] verification is 'perfect'. So only $1$ verification is required. [see 2.  Incentive Parent Node to Verify]",
    "The parent node is responsible for the verification because [1] he decides who is invited [2] from the point of view of invited children, the first point is the parent. [3] nobody except for the recruiter may have the authority/ability to question the recruit",
    "The parent node is also required to incentivize to participate, instead of not participating [see 3. Incentive Parent Node to Refrain from not Participating]"
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "In the balloon search challenge, other than mobilizing people to participate, a great challenge is distinguishing accurate balloon submission from inaccurate ones.",
    "Verification is of great importance in referral-based crowdsourcing settings to filter out false submissions before they reach the root."
