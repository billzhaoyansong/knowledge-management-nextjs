    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a Gradual Participant Selection scheme__ for Auction-based Federated Learning (GPS-AFL) to mitigate the drawbacks of selection bias in reputation-based FL, achieving [1] lower hiring cost [2] higher total utility, compared to [1] Greedy [2] Sharpley Value-based Method (SV) [3] OORT [4] ROBO-AFL [5] RRAFL",
    "in the proposed scheme, clients are selected gradually over multiple rounds of training with a hiring upper bound for each round",
    "when the regret queue is higher than $0$, only reputable clients (reputation threshold) are selected (and costs might be saved); otherwise, clients with the lowest costs are hired until round budget is reached"
  ],
  "systemModel": [
    "a set $\\mathcal{F}=\\{1, .., f,.., F\\}$ of servers (federations) with a singular FL task and a hard deadline $D_f$ ",
    "a set $\\mathcal{N}=\\{1,\\dots,n,\\dots,N\\}$ of data owners (DOs)",
    "step 1): $f$ creates the FL task with the total budget $\\theta_f$",
    "step 2): determines the budget for each round $\\theta_f(t)$ [see <u>1. Budget Allocation</u>]",
    "step 3): interested DOs submit their bids to $f$ and $f$ will get a bid vector $\\mathcal{B}=\\{b_1(t), \\dots, b_n(t),\\dots, b_N(t)\\}$",
    "step 4): $f$ select clients [see <u>2. Client Selection</u>] and selected DOs perform local training",
    "step 5): $f$ aggregates models, pays the selected DOs as their bidding price, and updates the reputations for participating DOs [see <u>3. Reputation</u>]",
    "step 2)- 5) continue unless [1] reaching deadline $D_f$ or [2] desired accuracy is achieved"

  "motivation": [
    "Currently, reputation-based FL faces two key challenges.",
    "The first is the cold start problem.",
    "Reputation building requires prior interactions between federations and participants.",
    "If the selection criteria require DOs to achieve certain minimum reputation scores, it is a challenge for newly joined DOs to have access to FL model training opportunities in order to build their reputation.",
    "Secondly, reputation-based FL participant selection can introduce bias into the resulting models.",
    "The general preference for highly reputable DOs can introduce biases in the models by repeatedly engaging a small group of them.",
    "This can be detrimental to an FL ecosystem due to herding on reputable DOs.",
    "It can also reduce the diversity of data samples FL models are trained upon, thereby negatively impacting their generalizability",
    "Furthermore, existing works do not allow for reputation redemption.",
    "Thus, if a DO's reputation falls below a threshold, it is precluded from future opportunities to participate in FL and therefore, unable to build its reputation through self-improvement."
