    [
      "step 1): a task publisher publishes a task with specific data requirements (data sizes, types, and time span)",
      "step 2): the task publisher downloads recommended reputation opinions from the reputation blockchain, and calculates composite reputations [see <u>1. Composite Reputation Calculation</u>], and selects workers with a reputation threshold",
      "step 3): federated learning and the task publisher carries out poisoning attack detection schemes (ROIN, FoolsGold) to detect poisoning attacks and unreliable workers",
      "step 4): reputation update [see <u>2. Direct Subjective Opinions and Reputation Update</u>]"
    ]
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "during a federated learning process, data owners may mislead a global model by intentional or unintentional behaviors [5].",
    "For intentional behaviors, an attacker can send malicious updates, that is, the poisoning attack, to affect the global model parameters resulting in the failure of current collaborative learning.",
    "In addition, much more dynamic mobile networking environments indirectly result in some unintentional behaviors of data owners.",
    "The data owners may also indeliberately update low-quality models caused by high-speed mobility or energy limitation, thus adversely affecting federated learning.",
    "Therefore, it is of paramount importance for federated learning to defend against such intentionally and unintentionally unreliable local model updates."
