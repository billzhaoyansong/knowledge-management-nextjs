    "propose __a hierarchical aggregation framework__ to (1) resolve single point of failure and (2) reduce communication cost incurred by resource-constrained FL clients, achieving (1) higher test accuracy (due to reputation(accuracy)-based selection) and (2) lower communication cost, compared with (1) Classical FL protocol (2) Hierarchical FL [5]",
    "the framework is composed of (1) a global server (2) edge servers (3) clients",
    "in the framework, a reputation-based client selection method is used to select clients for aggregation to minimize unnecessary local update exchange"
  ],
  "systemModel": [
    "$1$ global server, $L$ edge servers (local gateways), $K$ clients",
    "process 1): each edge server selects $R$ clients to perform local training",
    "process 2): after local training, each client estimates its reputation score [see <u>1. Reputation </u>] and model similarity [see <u>2. Model Similarity </u>] and shares with the edge server",
    "process 3): the edge servers rank clients based on reputation values and select clients whose similarity is higher than the average similarity for local aggregation",
    "process 4): edge servers upload aggregated models to the global server for global aggregation"

  "motivation": [
    "As a result of this centralized aggregation, a worn-out server acts as the sole point of contact for all clients, which could result in data loss in the event of a breakdown.",
    "Additionally, due to the constrained computational capabilities, point-to-point communication between FLClients and server is not always reliable.",
    "Due to the possibility of FLClients' updates being lost during the model exchange, this may impact the correctness of the global model.",
    "Additionally, since every FLClient update is transmitted to the global server during each FL round, the communication cost incurred by FLClients rapidly rises. ",
    "Reputation is employed as a decision variable for client selection in specific proposals, such as [3], before aggregating their local models."
