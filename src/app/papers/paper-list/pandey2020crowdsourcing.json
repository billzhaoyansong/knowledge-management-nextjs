        "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a rewarding mechanism__ by modeling the interaction between the MEC server and participating workers as a stackelberg game to achieve [1] higher gain in the offered reward comparing to the ablations",

        "$1$ MEC server, a set of clients $\\mathcal{K}$",
        "step 1): the MEC server announce a uniform reward rate $r$",
        "step 2): clients choose accuracy level $\\theta_k$ ($\\theta_k$ is a relative accuracy, and A smaller value of relative accuracy $\\theta_k$ indicates a high local accuracy) according to the reward rate $r$ to maximize self utility [see 1. stage II]",
