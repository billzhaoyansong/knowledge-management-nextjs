  "motivation": [
    "In cross-silo FL, since clients usually belong to different entities), each client may behave selfishly to maximize its own benefit.",
    "Specifically, each client selfishly chooses its participation level (i.e., the amount of local data) for the local training steps.",
    "The total amount of local data chosen by all clients will affect the global model accuracy, while the model training leads to costs to clients.",
    "In practice, clients have heterogeneous valuations for global model accuracy [9], and will make a tradeoff between the achieved global model accuracy and the incurred cost.",
    "On the other hand, clients with low valuations for global model accuracy may choose not to perform local training to reduce the cost, and we call such clients as free riders.",
    "This motivates us to study clientsâ€™ selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL through a game-theoretic approach.",
    "In this paper, we aim at addressing the following fundamental question in cross-silo FL."
