    "propose __a socially-aware framework for edge networks__ in which [1] devices are clustered by considering edge betweenness, social similarity, and physical distance, and [2] loss function is minimized by optimizing clustering, resource allocation, and relative local accuracy",
    "the framework includes clustering, in which heads are chosen considering edge betweenness, social similarity, and physical distance between devices)",
    "in this framework, an optimization problem is formulated for minimizing the customized loss function by optimizing clustering, resource allocation, and relative local accuracy",
    "the problem is decomposed into 3 sub-problems which are solved iteratively"

  "motivation": [
    "In conventional FL, a malicious aggregation server can use devices local learning models for inferring their private information, thus causing privacy leakage",
    "FL will generally suffer from high convergence time if the number of end devices increases under wireless resources constraints.",
    "The centralized aggregation server in FL might stop working due to physical damage or security attack"

    "solve the centralized server problem in conventional FL, more specifically the problems of malicious aggregation server, external attack, physical damage, communication efficiency"
