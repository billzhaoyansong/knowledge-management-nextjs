    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a smart contract-based rewarding mechanism__ to maximize the profit of task publishers and reward data owners according to data qualities",
    "_Problem_: in FL it is challenging to design incentive mechanisms due to information asymmetry issues. Specifically, these issues include (1) willingness of clients to join, (2) reputations of clients, (3) amount of data size and computational resources, (4) local data quality",
    "_Solution_: the authors proposed a smart contract-based incentive mechanism (IM) and reliable client selection scheme, achieving [1] higher performance under attacks",
    "clients are selected by a reputation threshold",
    "the task publisher design a smart contract which divides clients into different types according to data quality, to maximize the profit of the task publisher and reward clients based on their quality",
    "clients choose different contract item to maximize self-utility (minimize energy consumption)"

      "a task publisher designs contract items, and broadcasts the contract and resource requirements (data type, data sizes, accuracy, time range, and CPU cycles) to mobile devices [see <u>1. Smart Contract</u>]<ol>",
      "interested mobile devices give responses including resource information back to the task publisher",
      "the task publisher downloads recommended reputations from the reputation blockchain, and combines them with direct reputation opinion to generate a compositive reputation value [see <u>2. Reputation Calculation</u>]",
      "the task publisher selects workers with reputations larger than a threshold",
      "selected workers choose a contract item according to the accuracy of local dataset and resource conditions to minimize energy consumption [see 3. <u>Utility Function of a type-$n$ worker</u>]",

      "Workers obtain rewards from the task publisher according to the pre-set rewards in the contact items.",
      "Update reputation opinions to the reputation blockchain"
    ]
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "federated learning is still facing with critical challenges",
    "On the one hand, existing studies have an optimistic assumption that all the mobile devices contribute their resource unconditionally [4], [5], which is not practical in the real world due to resource cost incurred by model training [6]",
    "Without well-designed economic compensation, the self-interested mobile devices are reluctant to participate in model training",
    "Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective incentive mechanism for stimulating mobile devices to become workers for federated learning tasks",
    "On the other hand, an unreliable worker may perform intentionally or unintentionally undesirable behaviours to mislead a global model training of a federated learning task",
    "For the intentional behaviors, the worker may launch a poisoning attack that sends malicious updates to influence the global model parameters leading to the failure of current collaborative learning mechanism",
    "Moreover, much more dynamic mobile networking environments indirectly cause some unintentional behaviors of mobile devices",
    "Due to the high mobility or energy constraints, the worker may indeliberately update some low-quality parameters that adversely affect federated learning tasks",
    "Thus it is of vital importance to develop efficient schemes to select workers without unreliable local model updates for the federated learning",
    "Furthermore, these two challenges cannot be solved separately due to their couplings"
