    "investigates how FL impacts price competition between 2 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, revealing that **while FL improves service quality, it can reduce profits by intensifying price competition** when stationsâ€™ data distributions are moderately dissimilar. Using a game-theoretic model and real-world data, the study shows that **FL adoption hinges on balancing data heterogeneity, QoS gains, and competitive dynamics**."
