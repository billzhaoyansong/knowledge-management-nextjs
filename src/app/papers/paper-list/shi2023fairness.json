  "motivation": [
    "One category of FL client selection approaches focuses on fulfilling the goals of the FL servers.",
    "However, such an approach disregards the FL clients' interest (e.g., opportunities to participate in FL) and may cause some of them to perceive that they are not fairly treated by the FL system.",
    "Fairness-aware FL client selection approaches started to emerge in recent years.",
    "Some focus on ensuring that data owners have guaranteed rates to be selected to join FL.",
    "Others attempt to give more preference to high-performing FL clients while offering equitable opportunities for others to be selected to join FL.",
    "Nevertheless, the problem of balancing performance and fairness considerations when selecting FL clients remains open."
