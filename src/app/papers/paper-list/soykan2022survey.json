        "Traditional centralized ML requires data sharing, which poses privacy and legal risks. Collaborative ML (e.g., Federated Learning) addresses this but still has privacy vulnerabilities.",

        "Survey PETs (SMPC, HE, DP, CC) in the context of collaborative ML.",
        "Offer guidelines for selecting PETs based on collaboration requirements and constraints."
