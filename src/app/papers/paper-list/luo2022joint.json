  "motivation": [
    "However, HFLMEN is both time and energy consuming due to the following reasons.",
    "First, to ensure model convergence, FL typically requires a large number of clients to perform an iterative and long-term on-device model training, which incurs significant energy consumption on low-power devices.",
    "Second, given the very limited computing capacities and communication resources of UEs, how clients use computing and communication resources to perform on-device training also impacts learning time of FL jobs and energy consumption of devices a lot.",
    "Despite many efforts on resource management for FL, existing research is insufficient in optimizing the learning time and energy consumption, especially when multiple FL jobs coexist in the HFLMEN system.",
    "As a result, concurrent multiple FL jobs is very common in the HFLMEN system.",
    "Recent work [3]â€“[5] focuses on optimizing client selection for single FL job, which is difficult to obtain the optimal performance due to the inability to handle the resource competition among multiple FL jobs.",
    "Other work on resource allocation [6][9] assumes that the clients participating in each FL job are always available throughout training process.",
    "However, this assumption is unrealistic.",
    "Because of UE mobility and unreliable 5G wireless channel, clients who are previously available may be disconnected and become unavailable at a later time before training completes."
