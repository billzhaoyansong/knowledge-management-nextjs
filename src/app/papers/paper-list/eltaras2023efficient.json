    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a protocol for aggregation__ which __[1] masks gradients to preserve privacy__ and __[2] verifies the correctness of the aggregated results__ in an honest-but-curious environment, to prevent adversaries to track and deduce private information and preserve communication-efficiency",
    "to ensure confidentiality of the user's local gradients, a single-masking protocol is used",
    "to verify the aggregated results, a double aggregation technique is used instead of cryptographic primitives used in many literature work"
