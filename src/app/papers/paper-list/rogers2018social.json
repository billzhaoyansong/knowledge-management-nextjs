    "__reviews research of behavioral disciplines to derive strategies__ for prompting people to perform collectively meaningful behaviors",
    "social mobilization refers specifically to principles to influence a large number of individuals to participate in such activities.",
    "motivational force of social mobilization is amplified by 1) encouraging beneficial behaviors 2) people are embedded in social network",
    "this article is useful to people in the provision of 1) public goods, 2)collective action, and 3) prosocial behavior",
    "special attention is given to field experiments on 1) election participation, 2) environmentally sustainable behaviors, and 3) charitable giving"
  ],
  "systemModel": [
    "In this review, we organize behavioral principles for social mobilization into five intervention elements that have proven to be potent in the behavioral literature to effectively prompt many individuals to take personally costly actions. [see <u>1. Intervention Elements (PANIC) for Social Mobilization</u>]"
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "collective action is commonly modeled using a public goods game (or related n-player prisoner's dilemma), in which each player chooses (usually privately)",
    "Rational choice theory predicts that all players will free ride (Nash equilibrium)",
    "nevertheless, laboratory experiments frequently observe high levels of contribution in these games, especially when participants expect others to cooperate",
    "A basic psychological motive underlying many of the social mobilization principles that we discuss is people's fundamental need to belong or feel socially connected to others."

          "1. more personal interactions undoubtedly garner more attention",
          "2. when people are asked in face-to-face interactions to perform other-benefiting behaviors, they tend to believe that",
          "3. partly because of this heightened perception of the social costs of declining",
          "4. people may grow concerned that they could encounter the elicitor in the future",
          "5. more personal interactions likely foster deeper personal connections, and in turn, engages people's empathy and their fundamental desire for acceptance,",
          "6. more personal interactions create opportunities to notice similarities between oneself and another person"

        "<u>Personalized potential beneficiaries</u>: Social mobilization efforts are more effective when beneficiaries are identified or determined in advance.",

        [
          "Perceived similarity among those participating in such events—such as similarity in perceived identity (e.g., women) or even clothing (e.g., wearing a knitted pink hat)—can foster social bonds among them",

        "<u>Foot-in-the-door</u>: Small, initial requests for other-benefiting behaviors can promote other-benefiting identities and lead people to be open to larger, related requests.",
        "<u>Self-prediction</u>: People tend to believe that they will perform other-benefiting behaviors that they might not actually perform, but people's desire to behave consistently with what they say can make self-predictions self-fulfilling.",

        "<u>Communities on the periphery of a larger social network</u>: When contagion depends on redundant messages from similar people, social mobilization may be enhanced by targeting communities of individuals on the periphery of a larger network."
