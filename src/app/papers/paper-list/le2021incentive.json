    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __an auctioning mechanism__ which __[1] selecting clients to maximize the difference between accuracy and true cost__ and __[2] rewarding clients based on local accuracies__",
    "in the auction game, mobile devices bid with the information after optimizing local resources by jointly minimizing total completion time and total energy consumption after setting a time deadline in constraint",
    "the client selection problem is formulated by maximizing social welfare which considers local accuracy and claimed cost after setting resources constraints",
    "payments are based on local accuracies, local provided resources, and the highest normalized value of losing mobile users"

  "systemModel": [
    "$1$ base station (BS) and a set $\\mathcal{N}$ of $N$ users",
    "auction process (1): BS initializes the global network model",
    "auction process (2): BS announces the auction rule and advertises the FL task to the mobile users",
    "auction process (3): mobile users submit a set of $I_n$ of bids to the BS, each bid $\\Delta_{ni}={b_{ni}, A_{ni}, \\epsilon_{ni}, v_{ni}}$ where $b_{ni}$ is sub-channel number, $A_{ni}$ is antenna number, $\\epsilon_{ni}$ is local accuracy, $v_{ni}$ is claimed cost (bid price)[see 1. Bid Decision]",
    "auction process (4): BS selects clients using the indicator $x_{ni}$ [see 2. Client Selection]",
    "auction process (5): the winning mobile users join the FL and receive the payment after finishing the training model [see 3. Incentive Mechanism]"

  "motivation": [
    "In spite of the above mentioned benefits of FL, there are remaining two key challenges of having an efficient FL framework.",
    "The first challenge is the economic challenge.",
    "Data samples per mobile device are small to train a high-quality learning model so a large number of mobile users are needed to ensure cooperation.",
    "In addition, the mobile users who join the learning process are independent and uncontrollable.",
    "Here, mobile users may not be willing to participate in the learning due to the energy cost incurred by model training.",
    "In other words, the base station (BS), which generates the global model, has to stimulate the mobile users for participation.",
    "The second challenge is the technical challenge.",
    "On the one hand, we need users to collectively provide a large number of data samples to enable FL without sharing their private data.",
    "On the other hand, we need to protect model from imperfect updates.",
    "The global loss minimization problem should enable in (a) proper assessment of the quality of the local solution to improve personalization and fairness amongst the participating clients while training a global model, (b) effective decoupling of the local solvers, thereby balancing communication and computation in the distributed setting.",
    "Moreover, we need to consider wireless resource limitations (such as time, antenna number and bandwidth) affecting the performance of FL.",
    "Besides, the limited energy of wireless devices is a crucial challenge for deploying FL.",
    "Indeed, it is necessary to optimize the energy efficiency for FL implementation because of these resource constraints."

  "questions": [
    "it is impractical that all users will sacrifice their resources to join the FL algorithm."
