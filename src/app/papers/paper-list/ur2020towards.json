  "motivation": [
    "Edge devices normally operate in heterogeneous environments whereby heterogeneity arises at all levels of MEC in terms of battery power, sensors and their data collection settings, types of data sources, processing capabilities, communication interfaces, data being generated, types and granularity of learning models, learning rates of applications, sparsity in datasets, frequency of incoming data streams, missing and noisy data, and application of statistical inferencing techniques [14]",
    "In addition, the mobility and limited battery power bring the issue of asynchronization in FL model training whereby devices abruptly leave the model training processes and either completely fail or delay in reporting the local updates",
    "This asynchronization issue results in centralized model training over an obsolete data streams which may not be relevant in certain scenarios and applications requiring real-time or near-real-time model updates",
    "The establishment of secure communication channels is another issue because of knowledge sharing among devices",
    "Finally, the incentive mechanisms are required to attract and engage the edge devices to ensure a fully-participating finegrained FL in MEC systems",
    "The complexities and the involvement of multiple participants in MEC-based fine-grained FL systems cause the heterogeneity in multiple forms (i.e., raw data, pre-processed data, trained models, or deployed models) and at multiple levels (such as users, sensors, devices, data sources, edge devices, fog nodes, blockchain networks, cloud service providers, and application users)",
    "This massive heterogeneity creates a pressing demand to design a fully collaborative, trustworthy, and reliable fine-grained FL system",
    "Using an integrated blockchain-based decentralized reputation system could help in ensuring authenticity, traceability, provenance, incentivization, and penalization of all stakeholders in the fine-grained FL environments."
