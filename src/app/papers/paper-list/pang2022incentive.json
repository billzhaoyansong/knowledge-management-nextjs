    "propose __a procument (reverse) auction mechanism__ which selects and schedules different clients at different global iterations to achieve [1] lower social cost compared with [1] FAVOR and [2] CoCoA",
    "in the mechanism, the number of global iterations, scheduling decisions and incentive payouts are determined to minimize the social costs from one auction only",
    "an extension of multi-job scenario is considered and introduces a budget constraint"
  ],
  "systemModel": [
    "$1$ server and a set of FL clients $I$",
    "process 1): server broadcasts information of job to all FL clients $I$ [see 1. job broadcasting]",
    "process 2): clients submit $J$ bids [see 2. bidding]",
    "process 3): server determines number of global iterations, schedules training plan and determines payouts [see 3. social cost minimization]",
    "a multi-job extension is introduced [see 4. multi-job extension]"
  ],
  "motivation": [
    "To fully realize the potential of FL in practice, two types of challenges need to be addressed: technical and economical.",
    "First, on the technical side, both computation and communication are the core challenges.",
    "Second, on the economic side, incentive mechanism design is an indispensible enabling technology for FL.",
    "To overcome aforementioned challenges, one needs to capture the distinct feature of FL while designing incentive mechanisms, i.e., the relation between global accuracy and local accuracy among many mobile clients.",
    "Most existing research in FL focuses on the technical side, and investigates how to improve the training efficiency or reduce energy cost [6, 10, 11, 12].",
    "There are only a few studies on the incentive mechanism design in FL.",
    "Most work in FL assume that the same set of clients can fully participate in the whole FL training process from beginning to end, and select energy-efficient clients to achieve fairness or utility maximization [13, 14, 15, 16].",
    "In fact, incentive mechanism design has been well-studied in other related fields (e.g., mobile crowdsensing or crowdsourcing) by leveraging several approaches mentioned in Sec. 2. ",
    "On behalf of one of the representative incentivizing approaches, auction already showed its superiority. ",
    "In contrast to other incentive mechanism approaches (e.g., contract theory [17],[18]) in which clients can only decide whether or not to accept the contracts, auction enables clients to bid for any combinations of resources.",
    "Meanwhile, traditional fixed pricing cannot exactly capture the flexible supply-demand relationship between clients and the cloud server due to the heterogeneous capacities of devices.",
    "Consequently, overpricing and underpricing routinely occur, jeopardizing the cloud server’s profit as well as the system’s utility. ",
    "In contrast, auction is a natural approach to balance supply and demand, and automatically discover the right price, so that the cloud server can select clients with the lowest cost. ",
    "In addition, auction-based framework can simultaneously guarantee individual rationality and truthfulness."

    "2. bidding",
    [
      "the reason for 1 client to submit $J$ bids is that they value different local accuracy and period differently",
      "the contents in each bidding includes (1) claimed cost $b_{ij}$, (2) local accuracy $\\theta_{ij}$, (3) starts and ends of availability $a_{ij},d_{ij}$, and number of global iterations can participate due to battery limitation $c_{ij}$."
