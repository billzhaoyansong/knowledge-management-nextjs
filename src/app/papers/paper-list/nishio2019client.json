  "summaries": [
    "in the conventional FL framework, proposed __a client selection method__ to achieve shorter training time comparing to the original FL protocol by selecting as much clients as possible as long as the constraint of training time (client selection time + aggregation time + model update time + model upload time) is not violated",
    "the local model update time and upload time are calculated by their hardward conditions"

      "process (2): selected clients send back resource information to MEC",
      "process (3): based on the resource information, MEC selects the set of clients $\\mathbb{S}\\subseteq \\mathbb{K}'$ for FL training [see 1. client selection]",
      "process (4): model distribution, local training, model uploading, and aggregation"

  "motivation": [
    "In this work, we focus on the implementation of the abovementioned FL protocol in practical MEC frameworks.",
    "We believe that our work will influence the future development platform of various AI products that require a large amount of private activity data to train ML models",
    "In particular, we consider the problem of running FL in a cellular network used by heterogeneous mobile devices with different data resources, computational capabilities, and wireless channel conditions.",
    "Unfortunately, a direct application of existing FL protocols without any consideration of such heterogeneous client properties will make the overall trammg process inefficient.",
    "For instance, when some clients are with limited computational resources,they will require longer time to update models.",
    "Moreover,if the clients are under poor wireless channel conditions, that will result in longer update time.",
    "All such problems will delay the subsequent server's aggregation step necessary to continue the training process."

  "questions": [
    "mitigate the problem that clients with limited computational resources and wireless channel conditions will negatively affect FL performance"
