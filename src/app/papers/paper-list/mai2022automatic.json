  "motivation": [
    "However, there are still some challenges when implementing the FL framework over massive AIoT devices.",
    "Compared to centralized architecture, the FL participants are independent, uncontrollable, and self-interested.",
    "Because of the energy costs suffered from model training, AIoT devices are unwilling to participate in FL tasks or provide the redundant or low-quality local model.",
    "Therefore, designing an effective incentive scheme to simulate the data owner to actively participate in FL tasks is thus a priority problem."
