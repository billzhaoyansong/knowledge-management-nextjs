    "in the conventional FL framework, propose __a client selection policy__ for wireless network environment where channel resources are limited, to balance accuracy and efficiency, achieving [1] counter-attack [2] better convergence performance, compared to [1] random scheduling [2] round robin [3] proportional fair",
    "clients are selected to maximize the difference between reputations and the number of successful transmissions (to hire reputable clients while maintaining fairness among clients)",

    "since the BS has no knowledge about the local training process, it is vulnerable to various adversarial attacks from malicious UEs.",
