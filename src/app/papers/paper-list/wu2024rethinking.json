      "Although collaboration between domain-relevant clients (e.g. more overlapping features) boosts _performance_ and _speed of convergence_, it is _impossible_ to directly conduct domain relevance analysis between clients on the data level",
      "Previous studies employed the concept of personalized collaboration to tackle Non-IID data using _loss or model similarity_, which the authors proved that neither indicates __domain relevance__"

        "identify domain-relevant collaborators on the _model level_, instead of data level",
